# Responsive Grid Template

This is a cookiecutter template for starting HTML-based projects.

It provides features like a responsive grid without the weight of Bootstrap or other frameworks.

Install `cookiecutter` with `pip`.

Then run `$ cookiecutter <github_url>` to create a new project.

Don't forget to do `npm i` and then run `gulp` to build the CSS.

Part of the grid Sass is based on [Responsive Grid System](http://www.responsivegridsystem.com/).
