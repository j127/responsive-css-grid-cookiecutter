# Responsive Grid Template

This is a cookiecutter template for quick-starting HTML-based projects.

It provides features like a responsive grid without the weight of Bootstrap or other frameworks.

1. Install `cookiecutter` with `pip`.
1. Then run `$ cookiecutter <github_url>` to create a new project.
1. Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
1. Run `gulp` to build the CSS and compile the ES6 with Babel.
1. Run a server (e.g., `python3 -m http.server 8000`) and then visit your site: [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/).

Part of the grid Sass is based on [Responsive Grid System](http://www.responsivegridsystem.com/).

It's a work in progress. Pull requests are welcome.
